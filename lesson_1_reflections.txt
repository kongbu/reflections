How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I think it is a very good way to compare two versions and find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Use git log and git diff.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: can see the difference of each version with logical change
    cons: will generate a lot files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files(code functions) may depend on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to show the history and use git diff to compare commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Every change can be found in version control. And we can use git checkout to find it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Of course, version control!
